## 🎯 What is Meka?

> **Looking for a Siri alternative on Android? Meet Meka.**

Meka is an open-source **AI voice assistant for Android** that goes far beyond Google Assistant. Inspired by Tony Stark's JARVIS, Meka combines real-time voice recognition, Google Gemini's large language model intelligence, and deep Android system integration to give you an assistant that **actually understands you**.

Whether you want to:
- 🗣️ **Control your phone with your voice** (calls, SMS, alarms, volume, WiFi, Bluetooth)
- 🧠 **Have intelligent conversations** with full contextual memory
- 🔊 **Use a real wake word** ("Hey Meka") just like Siri
- 🌊 **See a Siri-style animated wave UI** while it listens
- 🔁 **Run persistently in the background** — always ready, even from the lock screen

...then Meka is the Android AI assistant you've been waiting for.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) `>=3.0.0`
- A [Google Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) (free tier available)
- Android device or emulator (API 21+) **or** Windows/Linux desktop

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BawanthaBeliwaththa/Meka.git
cd Meka
```

### 2. Generate Native Platform Files

> This step creates the `android/`, `windows/`, and `linux/` directories that are not tracked in source control.

```bash
flutter create --platforms=android,windows,linux .
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 4. Run the App

```bash
# Android
flutter run -d android

# Windows
flutter run -d windows

# Linux
flutter run -d linux
```

### 5. First-Time Setup

On first launch, Meka's setup wizard will guide you through:
1. **Entering your name** — Meka will address you personally
2. **Entering your Gemini API key** — powers all AI responses
3. **Granting permissions** — microphone, phone, SMS, storage

---

## 🛠️ Setup Guide

### Getting a Gemini API Key (Free)

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click **"Create API key"**
4. Copy the key
5. Paste it into Meka's setup screen or **Settings → API Key**

> 💡 The **Gemini Flash** model used by Meka is extremely fast and falls within Google's free tier for personal use.

### Android-Specific Permissions

Meka requires the following Android permissions for full functionality:

| Permission | Why It's Needed |
|---|---|
| `RECORD_AUDIO` | Voice input and wake word detection |
| `CALL_PHONE` | Making phone calls by voice |
| `SEND_SMS` | Sending text messages by voice |
| `READ_CONTACTS` | Calling/texting contacts by name |
| `CAMERA` | Taking photos via voice command |
| `READ/WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` | File browsing commands |
| `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` | Siri-style wave overlay over other apps |
| `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` | Always-on background service |
| `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` | Auto-start on device boot |
| `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS` | Keeps assistant alive in background |

> ⚠️ All permissions are **user-consented** and requested only when the relevant feature is first used. Meka never auto-escalates privileges.

### Android Native Source

The `android_src/` directory contains the Kotlin source files that must be placed in your generated Android module:

```
android_src/
├── MainActivity.kt            # Main Flutter activity + device control channel
├── MekaForegroundService.kt   # Always-on background service
└── BootReceiver.kt            # Auto-start on device boot
```

After running `flutter create`, copy these files to:
```
android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/example/meka/
```

## 🧠 How Meka Works

```
User speaks → Speech-to-Text (on-device)
                    ↓
             Text sent to Gemini Flash API
                    ↓
       Gemini returns response (text + optional JSON action)
                    ↓
     Meka parses JSON → executes Android action via MethodChannel
                    ↓
        TTS speaks the confirmation back to user
                    ↓
   (Optional) Siri-wave overlay displays during listening
```

### AI Action Commands

Meka uses a **structured JSON protocol** embedded in Gemini's responses to trigger native Android actions:

```json
{ "action": "open_app",    "app": "youtube"                       }
{ "action": "set_alarm",   "hour": 7, "minute": 0, "label": "Gym" }
{ "action": "send_sms",    "to": "Mom", "message": "On my way"    }
{ "action": "make_call",   "to": "John"                           }
{ "action": "set_volume",  "level": 70                            }
{ "action": "web_search",  "query": "weather today"               }
{ "action": "take_photo"                                           }
{ "action": "toggle_wifi"                                          }
{ "action": "toggle_bluetooth"                                     }
{ "action": "list_files",  "path": "/sdcard/Download"             }
{ "action": "read_file_content", "path": "/sdcard/note.txt"       }
{ "action": "find_files",  "query": "report"                      }
{ "action": "request_battery_optimization_ignore"                  }
```

  // Customize Meka's personality, tone, and capabilities here
  ''';
}
```

### Adding New App Launch Targets

In `android_src/MainActivity.kt`, extend the `packages` map:

```kotlin
val packages = mapOf(
    "youtube" to "com.google.android.youtube",
    "your_app" to "com.your.package.name",  // ← Add here
    // ...
)
```

### Changing the App Icon

1. Replace `assets/images/logo.png` with your icon (1024×1024 PNG recommended)
2. Run:
   ```bash
   dart run flutter_launcher_icons
   ```

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Is this a real Siri alternative for Android?**  
A: Yes! Meka provides voice-activated AI assistance, device control, and a Siri-style animated wave UI — all on Android. It uses Google Gemini instead of Apple's proprietary AI.

**Q: Does Meka work offline?**  
A: Speech recognition (STT) runs on-device. However, AI responses require an internet connection to reach the Gemini API.

**Q: Is my data private?**  
A: Your API key is stored locally on your device using `SharedPreferences`. Voice audio is processed locally by Android's STT. Text queries are sent to Google's Gemini API, subject to [Google's privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

**Q: Is the Gemini API free?**  
A: Yes, Google provides a generous free tier for Gemini Flash. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) for current limits.

**Q: Can I use this on iOS?**  
A: The Flutter UI works cross-platform, but the deep Android device control features (calls, SMS, overlay) are Android-only. iOS support would require a separate implementation.

**Q: How is this different from just using ChatGPT?**  
A: Meka is deeply integrated with Android system APIs. It doesn't just chat — it *acts*. It can make calls, set alarms, control volume, open apps, and display a system-wide overlay, all via voice.

## 🔌 ESP32 Hardware Integration

> *Turn Meka into a full smart-home voice controller.*

Meka can control an **ESP32 microcontroller** over your local WiFi network — giving you a real voice-controlled IoT hub. Flash the firmware, enter the IP in Settings, and start commanding your physical world.

### Architecture
```
You say: "Hey Meka, turn on relay 1"
         ↓
   Gemini AI: {"action":"esp32_relay","channel":1,"state":"on"}
         ↓
   Meka Flutter App → HTTP POST http://meka.local/relay
         ↓
   ESP32 Board → GPIO 26 → Relay Module → Physical Load (Light, Motor, etc.)
         ↓
   Meka speaks: "Relay 1 is now on, Sir."
```

### Default Wiring (ESP32 38-pin DevKit)
```
GPIO  │ Connected To
──────┼──────────────────────────
  2   │ Built-in LED / PWM output
  4   │ DHT22 temperature sensor
 13   │ NeoPixel RGB strip (Din)
 15   │ Buzzer
 18   │ Servo motor signal
 26   │ Relay channel 1
 27   │ Relay channel 2
 14   │ Relay channel 3
 12   │ Relay channel 4
 25   │ Relay channel 5
 33   │ Relay channel 6
 32   │ Relay channel 7
 19   │ Relay channel 8
 34   │ Analog input (ADC)
```

### Voice Commands
| Say to Meka | What Happens |
|---|---|
| *"Turn on relay 1"* | Relay 1 switches ON |
| *"Turn off relay 3"* | Relay 3 switches OFF |
| *"Set LED to blue"* | NeoPixels turn blue |
| *"Move servo to 90 degrees"* | Servo rotates to 90° |
| *"What is the temperature?"* | Reads DHT22 & speaks result |
| *"What is the humidity?"* | Reads DHT22 humidity |
| *"Dim LED to 50 percent"* | NeoPixel brightness 50% |
| *"Buzz the buzzer"* | Buzzer sounds 200ms |
| *"Reset all outputs"* | All relays OFF, servo & LEDs reset |

### Quick Setup
1. Install libraries in Arduino IDE (see [`esp32/README.md`](esp32/README.md))
2. Edit WiFi credentials in `esp32/meka_esp32/meka_esp32.ino`
3. Flash to your ESP32 board
4. Note the IP from Serial Monitor
5. In Meka App → **Settings → ESP32 Hardware Node** → enter IP → **Test Connection**
6. Start commanding your hardware!
